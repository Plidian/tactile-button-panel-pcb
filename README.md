📘 Tactile Button Panel PCB

Modular 12 mm Tactile Button + 2.54 mm Header Panels
A set of compact, easy-to-mount breakout PCBs for 12 mm tactile switches, designed to be snap-separated into 4 individual boards using V-cuts.
Perfect for custom controllers, DIY projects, prototyping, or embedding buttons into 3D-printed enclosures.

✨ Features

✔️ Uses standard 12 mm tactile switches

✔️ Standard 2.54 mm (0.1") pin headers

✔️ Panelized into 4 detachable boards

✔️ Clearly separated ground nets (GND1A, GND1B, GND2, GND3)

✔️ V-cut separation lines included on the board outline layer

✔️ M3 mounting holes for easy 3D-print integration

✔️ JLCPCB-friendly design (verified Gerbers)

📐 Board Layout

The panel consists of:

Single-button board (top-right)
